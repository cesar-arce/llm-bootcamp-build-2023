LLM Bootcamp - Part 1
Tuesday, December 5⋅17:15 – 18:45
Join our LLM Bootcamp over two days to learn how to build with generative AI on Snowflake. We'll cover LLM fundamentals, lecture style, then dive in, deploying Llama 2 in a container and fine tuning it to improve accuracy. Successfully complete the test to earn a digital badge you can display on your social profiles to show off your new skills. Part 1 is a prerequisite to part 2.

PLEASE NOTE:

Limited capacity: be sure to join on time to grab one of the limited user-ids with private preview access to Snowpark Container Services that you will need to complete the lab portions of the bootcamp. If you are not able to grab one of them, you will still be able to join the bootcamp and earn the badge by successfully completing the assessment.
